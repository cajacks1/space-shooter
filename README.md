YouTube Link for CSCI 490 Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ_W-9FcD5Q&feature=youtu.be

Download the game from itch.io by following this link: https://cajacks1.itch.io/star-shooter

# Itch.io Download Instructions
Download the three files from the link above.

The files should be under your Downloads folder like so:

![](/images/downloads-folder.png)

Make a simple directory to keep all of these files inside the same folder.  

For example, I created StarShooter folder within the Downloads directory:

![](/images/starshooter-folder.png)

Then, drag all of the downloaded files into the StarShooter directory and the folder will now have the files in there:

![](/images/starshooter-directory.png)

Next, extract StarShooter_Data.zip to the directory of your recently created folder.  

In this example, Star Shooter is the designated folder to extract, not StarShooter_Data within the StarShooter directory:

![](/images/extract-starshooter_data.png)
![](/images/destination-starshooter_data.png)

Now your folder should look something like this!  You do not need the StarShooter_Data.zip file anymore, so you may delete that file.

![](/images/all-documents-ready.png)

After that, your game should boot up StarShooter.exe and you should get the following screen:
